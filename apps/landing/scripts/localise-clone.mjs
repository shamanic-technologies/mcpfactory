/**
 * Third capture pass: bring a clone's CROSS-ORIGIN assets onto our own host.
 *
 *   node scripts/localise-clone.mjs https://gojiberry.ai/ gojiberry
 *
 * The other two passes take only same-origin responses, which is right for a site that
 * serves its own assets and useless for one that does not. A Framer page keeps every
 * image, font and bundle on `framerusercontent.com`, so `clone-site.mjs` and
 * `capture-live.mjs` together capture TWO files and the "clone" is a shell that renders
 * entirely out of somebody else's CDN.
 *
 * So this pass mirrors those assets under `__external/<host>/…` and rewrites the
 * references to point at them. That is a deliberate exception to the leave-the-bytes-alone
 * rule, and the ONLY one: it changes references, never content. The catalogue records
 * which hosts were rapatriated (`localisedHosts`) so a clone never quietly claims to be
 * more local than it is.
 *
 * What is mirrored is decided by what the page ASKS FOR and what comes back: a
 * cross-origin response carrying an asset content-type. Analytics, tag managers, pixels
 * and embedded players are left pointing at their origin — they are not the page, and
 * rewriting a tracker's endpoint would only break it in a confusing way.
