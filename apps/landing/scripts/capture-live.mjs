/**
 * Second capture pass: record what a REAL BROWSER fetches from a competitor landing.
 *
 *   node scripts/capture-live.mjs https://explee.com/ explee
 *
 * `clone-site.mjs` reads the markup and walks the references it can see. That misses two
 * whole classes of asset, and both are visible on screen:
 *
 *  - a CSS/JS chunk whose URL the bundle ASSEMBLES at runtime from a chunk map, so the
 *    path exists as `{"0mwfz":"3.hp8_b"}` in a manifest and as no string anywhere;
 *  - anything loaded lazily — testimonial avatars, below-the-fold imagery — which is
 *    requested only once the element approaches the viewport.
 *
 * So this pass loads the page, scrolls the whole height to trigger the lazy work, and
 * writes every same-origin response to the same paths `clone-site.mjs` uses. It ADDS to
 * a capture; it never removes. Run the static pass first (it reaches pages and assets a
 * single visit does not request), then this one.
