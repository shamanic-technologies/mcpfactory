 * someone deliberately makes it ours, which is what `brandised` records.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing and enforced by `tests/unit/clone-serving.test.ts`:
 * a clone is reachable ONLY through the host named here (so nothing is discoverable by
 * guessing a path on distribute.you), and every entry has files on disk (so a host that
 * resolves cannot 404 its way through the whole site).
