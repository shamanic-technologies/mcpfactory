/**
 * Host routing for the competitor clones, and NOTHING else.
 *
 * `lab-<slug>.distribute.you` serves a mirrored competitor landing from
 * `apps/landing/clones/<slug>/` (see src/lib/clone-catalogue.ts). Serving each clone at
 * the ROOT of its own host is what makes the mirror faithful without editing a byte: a
 * captured page is full of root-absolute references (`/_next/static/…`, `/css/site.css`,
 * `url(/img/hero.png)`), and they resolve on a subdomain exactly as they did on the
 * origin. Under a path prefix every one of them would have to be rewritten, which is a
 * change to bytes we deliberately have not read.
 *
 * ⚠️ The FIRST statement is the exit for every ordinary landing request. This file runs
 * on every request the app serves — there is no `config.matcher`, because a clone host
 * legitimately needs `/_next/*` and any matcher that excludes static paths would exclude
 * the clone's own assets. So the cost on distribute.you must stay at one host comparison,
 * and no work of any kind may be added above that check.
