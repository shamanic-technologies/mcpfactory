// The funnels an OFFER is sold through, and what each one is worth. Several can
// run at once, and each keeps its own conversion rates, lifetime revenue and
// landing page, because a self-serve purchase customer and an enterprise meeting
// customer are not worth the same and do not land on the same page.
//
// The scope is the OFFER, never the brand. A brand is an identity; an offer is
// the proposition, and conversion rates, lifetime revenue and destinations are
// facts about the proposition. brand-service still serves the brand-scoped funnel
// routes and resolves them to the brand's sole offer, which is why the card
// worked before the offer level shipped — but on a page that names ONE offer
// those routes write to whichever offer the service picks, and they answer 409
// SEVERAL_OFFERS the moment a brand has two. So every read and every write here
// carries the offer, and the query key carries it too: two offers of one brand
// sharing one cache entry would show each other's funnels.
//
// The MONEY is the exception, and deliberately so: billing keys a ceiling on
// (org, brand, funnel, acquisition channel) and has no offer dimension, so the
// budgets stay on the brand-scoped billing routes and the brand-scoped key.
//
// brand-service stores all of it PER FUNNEL, so this card writes: confirming a
// funnel declares it and prices it, removing one drops its economics with the
// declaration. The write is a PARTIAL patch built by `buildFunnelPatch` — only
// the fields whose value actually changed travel, so editing one rate cannot
// overwrite the others and emptying a field really clears it.
//
// A funnel the brand has NOT declared is prefilled from its blended sales
// economics so the numbers on screen are its own. That prefill is for a person
// to confirm and is never written on its own: the patch omits any field that
// still equals what is stored, so a number nobody confirmed cannot read back as
// one the brand declared.
//
// Choosing a funnel, and dropping one, are decisions about how the brand sells.
// Neither is one tap on a checkbox: both go through opening the card and
// pressing a button that says what it does.

                sold through. Whole dollars, never cents — a daily budget is a
                configured ceiling, not a charge. Empty means that channel is not
                funded, which is how one offer is put down without forgetting how
                the funnel sells: every number above stays as it is, and the
                funnel's other channels keep running.

                Funding a channel IS choosing it, which is why there is no toggle
                beside these fields: a switch would be a second way to say what
                the amount already says.

                It sits BELOW the funnel's own inputs, full width, one row per
                channel — a channel is a thing the brand funds, not a field, and
                squeezed into a quarter of the input grid the mark, the name and
                the amount had no room to read as one line. */}
