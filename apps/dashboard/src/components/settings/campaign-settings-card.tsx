/**
 * Campaign Settings — is this campaign running, and what may it spend in a day.
 *
 * A campaign IS (offer x sales funnel x acquisition channel), and it carries TWO
 * independent answers to that question:
 *
 *   - a STATUS, which campaign-service stores on the campaign row;
 *   - a daily CEILING, which billing keys on exactly that triple.
 *
 * They are deliberately NOT one field, and this page is where a customer states
 * both. Pausing keeps the ceiling untouched, so restarting is one click and the
 * amount is still there; zeroing the ceiling throws the amount away, and
 * billing's per-funnel floor only lets a funnel funded under its minimum be KEPT
 * or RAISED — so a campaign grandfathered under the floor, stopped that way,
 * could never be restarted at the figure it was running. Pause is therefore what
 * the copy offers, and zero survives as the way to genuinely defund.
 *
 * Both are committed by ONE Save, so a toggle that writes instantly does not sit
 * beside a field that does not. What it is about to do is stated above the
 * button rather than reported after: money and a campaign's life are what this
 * screen changes.
 *
 * The narrowing that turns billing's per-pair figure into THIS campaign's money
 * lives in `lib/campaign-budget.ts`, because the Campaigns table and the campaign
 * Overview state the very same figure read-only, and the controls modal edits it
 * at three grains. Several windows onto one number are fine; a second narrowing
 * is how they would come to disagree.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT ON THIS PAGE:
 *   - the campaign's NAME, its audiences and its click destination. Those are
 *     statements about the OFFER, which has its own Settings page.
 *   - the offer, the funnel, the channel, the feature. Those are what the
 *     campaign IS: changing one does not configure this campaign, it makes it
 *     another one.
