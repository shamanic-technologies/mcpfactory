/**
 * Is this running, and how hard — for a brand, an offer, or one campaign.
 *
 * ONE modal, three entry points. The rows are always CAMPAIGNS whatever the
 * grain, because a campaign is the only thing either write can address: the
 * brand and the offer are scopes, not things billing or campaign-service fund.
 * A grain that edited an aggregate would have to split it back across the
 * campaigns, and no split the customer did not state is honest.
 *
 * A row is a campaign as the CUSTOMER knows it — (funnel x channel x offer) —
 * never one campaign-service row. campaign-service mints a fresh row on every
 * workflow change and keeps only the newest `ongoing`, so one campaign is stored
 * as many; listing them per row showed the same campaign dozens of times, each
 * offering to edit the one billing ceiling they all share.
 *
 * Each row carries the two answers a campaign has, and they stay INDEPENDENT:
 *
 *   - a toggle, which flips campaign-service's own status. It costs nothing to
 *     reverse and leaves the ceiling untouched, so the amount survives a pause.
 *   - a daily budget, billing's (offer x funnel x channel) row.
 *
 * Collapsing the two into one field (pause = set it to zero) is what this
 * replaces: zero throws the amount away, and billing's per-funnel floor only
 * lets a funnel funded under its minimum be KEPT or RAISED — so a campaign
 * grandfathered under the floor, stopped that way, could never be restarted at
 * the figure it was running.
 *
 * ⚠️ Restarting FIRES THE WORKFLOW IMMEDIATELY rather than at the next tick, so
 * the summary above Confirm says so.
 *
 * The writes are a FAN-OUT (there is no bulk endpoint), so a failure is reported
 * per row and the modal stays open. It never claims a success it does not have.

/**
 * The funnel a group of campaigns sells, with the two things that group ADDS UP to.
 *
 * Neither figure is written here. The daily budget is READ-ONLY on purpose: billing
 * keys a ceiling on (funnel x channel x offer), so the only thing a customer can
 * fund is a campaign, and a funnel-level field would have to split its figure back
 * across them. It tracks the fields below it as they are typed, so the parent moves
 * the moment a child does.
 *
 * The switch DOES write, because pausing is a status and every campaign carries its
 * own — flipping the heading sets each of them. It reads OFF only once every campaign
 * under it is off, which is the same rule the scope pill states, so a funnel with one
 * live campaign never reads as stopped.
