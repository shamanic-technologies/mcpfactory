/**
 * Pure helpers for the persisted React Query cache. No React / Clerk imports, so
 * they unit-test in a plain node env (mirrors `nextRevealState` in
 * `use-coordinated-reveal.ts`).
 *
 * This is the 4th anti-flash layer (see CLAUDE.md → "Coordinated reveal"):
 *  1. `placeholderData: keepPreviousData` — keeps a query's DATA across refetch.
 *  2. `useCoordinatedReveal`            — keeps a group's REVEAL across refetch.
 *  3. `useMonotonicStatuses`            — keeps a row's BUCKET across refetch.
 *  4. persisted cache (this file)       — restores the last-known content on
 *     return / reload instead of cold-loading a skeleton.
 *
 * POLICY (2026-06-25 — "local-first SWR cache: open a page → its content NOW"):
 * the dashboard is a LOCAL-FIRST, stale-while-revalidate (SWR) surface — the on-disk
 * cache is the source the UI paints FIRST, the network is secondary (TkDodo: "stale
 * data is better than no data, because no data means a loading spinner = perceived
 * slow"). The allowlist holds EVERY live non-sensitive query root, big lists
 * included, so NO page cold-skeletons after the first ever load.
 *
 * PERSISTER = the PER-QUERY persister (`experimental_createQueryPersister`,
 * query-provider.tsx), NOT the old whole-client `persistQueryClient`. Two reasons it
 * is strictly better for this polling-heavy app (TanStack docs "createPersister"):
 *   1. Each query is written to storage SEPARATELY (keyed by its query hash), only
 *      when IT changes — so a 5s poll of one query does NOT re-serialize the whole
 *      cache. This kills the main-thread "lourd/lent" jank of the whole-client
 *      persister, which re-`dehydrate()`d the ENTIRE set on every mutation (#9775).
 *   2. A query persisted to disk survives even after it is GC'd from MEMORY — disk
 *      retention is DECOUPLED from `gcTime`. That lets disk retention run for weeks
 *      (no cross-session cold skeleton) WITHOUT pinning anything in the JS heap for
 *      anywhere near that long. `gcTime` stays a modest bound on
 *      MEMORY only (the #1273 heap-overflow lever); the disk holds it regardless.
 *
 * STORAGE = IndexedDB (idb-keyval), NOT localStorage. localStorage's hard ~5MB
 * per-origin cap was the regression: a big list (leads/emails on a heavy brand)
 * blew the cap → `removeOldestQuery` evicted the small overview queries → the
 * overview cold-skeletoned on the slow Neon path (the very thing persist-all was
 * meant to prevent). IndexedDB has no such cap, so nothing is evicted and big-list
 * pages persist fully too.
 *
 * NB admin ≠ dashboard: `admin.distribute.you` is a SEPARATE origin with its OWN
 * storage — its heavy outlets/journalists cache never touches this dashboard cache.
 *
 * SAFETY (cross-deploy shape drift, with no per-deploy bust):
 * `buster` (manual version, bumped by hand on an incompatible shape change) is the
 * only forced invalidation; `safeParse` / `z.coerce` on list readers, keep-last-good
 * `structuralSharing`, and the org-scoped `prefix` each tolerate a drifted shape.
 * The allowlist is an INVENTORY of live roots (default-OFF still holds for a future
 * UNKNOWN root, so a new query is opt-in, never silently auto-persisted).
 */

/**
 * Persisted-cache freshness window (the per-query persister `maxAge`). 30 DAYS,
 * and the fact that it is FINITE is the point.
 *
 * It used to be `Infinity`, on the reasoning that the per-query persister decouples
 * disk retention from `gcTime`, so keeping everything forever pins nothing in the JS
 * heap. That reasoning holds for one entry and fails for the STORE: nothing in the
 * design ever deleted anything, so every response this console has received since the
 * cache shipped was still on disk — across every god-mode org ever visited — and the
 * boot-time restore read all of it into memory at once (see `sweepStaleEntries`).
 *
 * 30 days is picked against how staff actually return to a page: a page opened in a
 * normal week never comes near it, and the bucket of an org visited once in March
 * disappears. The cost of the bound is that a page untouched for a month
 * cold-skeletons ONCE, then is instant again — which is a fair price for a snapshot
