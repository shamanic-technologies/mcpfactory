// ONE campaign's own daily ceiling, resolved out of billing's answer.
//
// A campaign IS (offer x sales funnel x acquisition channel), and billing keys a
// ceiling on exactly that triple, so a campaign really does have money of its
// own. What it does NOT have is a figure of its own to compute: billing serves
// three grains (per funnel, per pair, per triple) and this module only ever
// PICKS one of them. Nothing here adds anything up.
//
// It lives in one place because three surfaces read it — the Campaigns table
// states it per row, the campaign Overview states it in its header, and Campaign
// Settings edits it — and three copies of the narrowing is how they would start
// disagreeing about the same campaign's money.
//
// Only relative value imports live here, so this module stays directly
// unit-testable (vitest does not resolve the "@" alias).
