// email to $8. The dashboard was STRICTER than the service that decides.

// The floor now comes from the channel's own published terms — see
// `channel-minimums.ts`, which reads `terms.dailyOperatingCostCents` off
// `GET /public/channels` — and billing holds the same rule against the same
// figure, so its 400 is the answer. Do not reintroduce a table of figures here.
