/**
 * The lookup that turns a campaign's stated `legKey` into the two steps it connects.
 *
 * Read from `GET /public/channels`, which is where features-service mints and
 * publishes those identifiers. It is a PLATFORM catalogue — no org, no brand, no
 * auth — so it is the same answer for every tenant and is cheap to hold: ~33 rows,
 * persisted like every other root, and it changes only when a channel is published.
 *
 * An empty index is the honest reading while the read is settling or has failed, and
 * it is safe by construction: `statedCampaignLeg` answers null against it, and every
 * caller falls through to the derivation it used before campaigns stated their leg.
 * So a failed catalogue read costs the SHARPER name, never the name.
