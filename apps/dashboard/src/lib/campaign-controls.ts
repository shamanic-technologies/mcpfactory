// Is this running, and how hard — for one campaign, one offer, or a whole brand.
//
// A campaign IS (offer x sales funnel x acquisition channel), and it carries TWO
// independent answers to that question:
//
//   - a STATUS, which campaign-service stores on the campaign row and flips
//     through `PATCH /campaigns/:id` with `activate` / `stop`;
//   - a daily CEILING, which billing keys on the triple and which
//     `saveBrandFunnelBudget` writes.
//
// They are deliberately NOT one field. Stopping a campaign by dropping its
// ceiling to zero would throw away the amount, and billing's floor only lets a
// funnel funded under its minimum be KEPT or RAISED — so a campaign
// grandfathered under the floor could be stopped that way and never restarted at
// the same figure. A status flag costs nothing to reverse, which is what makes
// "pause and resume" an ordinary action rather than a decision.
//
// This module holds the ROW MODEL the controls modal edits and the pure
// derivations around it. Every grain edits the same rows — a campaign — because
// that is the only thing either write can address: the brand and the offer are
// scopes, not things billing or campaign-service fund. Nothing here sums a
// brand-wide ceiling; billing serves that figure and the brand Overview reads it.
//
// Only relative value imports live here, so this module stays directly
// unit-testable (vitest does not resolve the "@" alias).

 *     one, so a live-only list would make stopping irreversible from the UI.
 *   - Only ACQUISITION-CHANNEL campaigns. A brand's PR or AI-visibility campaign
 *     runs no sales funnel, so it has no ceiling and belongs to no offer; listing
 *     it would offer a budget field that can never be written.
 *   - The offer filter reads the campaign's OWN `offerId`. A campaign carrying
 *     none belongs to no offer and is left out rather than folded into whichever
 *     one the reader happens to be looking at.
 *   - Rows are GROUPED by (funnel, channel, offer) — one line per campaign as a
 *     customer knows it, not one per stored row. campaign-service mints a fresh
 *     row on every workflow change, so one campaign is stored as many; a list
 *     per row shows the same campaign dozens of times, each offering to edit the
 *     ONE billing ceiling they all share, and a total that adds that ceiling up
 *     once per row. Measured in prod: one offer held 46 rows of a single
 *     campaign and read $2,310/day against a real $50.
 *
 * A campaign that predates the funnels names no triple, so it groups by its own
 * id: it has no ceiling to share and nothing to double count.
 *
 * Order is running-first then by identity, so the rows do not reshuffle under
 * the cursor as toggles are flipped — the sort key is the SAVED status, never
