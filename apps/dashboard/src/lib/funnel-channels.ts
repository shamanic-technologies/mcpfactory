// Which acquisition channels a sales funnel can be sold through, and what the
// brand has funded each of them at.
//
// A funnel is WHAT happens once a lead lands; a channel is WHERE we went to find
// them. The same funnel can be worked through several channels at once, each
// running its own campaign, so each carries its own daily ceiling and the funnel
// figure is their SUM. billing serves that sum, so nothing here adds one up.
//
// Not every channel can sell every funnel: the feedback-request offer buys a
// CONVERSATION, while the website-led funnels start with a click it has no way to
// sell. features-service states that per feature and this module reads it. Do
// NOT hardcode the matrix here, and do not infer it from a funnel's shape.
//
// Only relative value imports live here, so this module stays directly
// unit-testable (vitest does not resolve the "@" alias).

/**

 * channels and marks every one of them bookable, which is a statement about what
 * the agency SELLS; campaign-service provisions a campaign for a closed set of
 * them, which is a statement about what currently RUNS. Offering to fund one
 * outside that set takes a customer's ceiling and produces no campaign at all:
 * nothing errors, nothing is charged, and the channel simply never does
 * anything, which is worse than not offering it.
 *
 * This is NOT the hand-written catalogue this module used to filter. That one
 * decided which channels EXIST, so it went stale the moment the producer
 * published a new one and hid it from every surface. This decides only which are
 * FUNDABLE: a channel outside it still resolves, still carries its name and its
 * mark, and still names a campaign that already runs on it. The two questions
 * were conflated before, which is why one stale list could do so much damage.
 *
 * It is a mirror, so it is temporary by construction: the day campaign-service
 * states which features it can provision, this reads that instead and the list
 * goes. Until then, adding a slug here without adding it there offers a dead
 * channel, and adding it there without adding it here hides a live one.
 *
 * GOOGLE ADS IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, and the reason is one hop further out than
 * this mirror can see. Everything a Google Ads campaign needs to be created now
 * exists: google-service wraps the Ads API and declares the spend as the org's
 * cost, features-service publishes the channel, billing states its floor, and
 * campaign-service provisions and schedules the campaign. What does not exist is
 * a WORKFLOW for it, and prod holds 553 for cold email against zero here. So a
 * customer funding it would get a campaign that is provisioned, scheduled, and
 * then produces nothing forever, which is the precise failure this whole gate
 * exists to prevent: being able to provision a campaign is not being able to RUN
 * one. Add the slug when a workflow answers for it, not before.
 *
 * `ai-meeting-booking` is that same test answered the other way, and both are worth
 * keeping here: the two channels differ in exactly the one thing this list is about.
 * Everything else was equally true of Google Ads on the day it was left out.
