/**
 * What each acquisition channel costs to run for a day — the floor a funded
 * ceiling must clear.
 *
 * Read from `GET /public/channels`, where features-service publishes every
 * channel's commercial terms, on the SAME query key the leg index already polls,
 * so knowing a floor costs no request. It is a PLATFORM catalogue — no org, no
 * brand, no auth — so it is the same answer for every tenant and changes only
 * when a channel is published or re-priced.
 *
 * NO floors is the honest reading while the read is settling or has failed, and
 * it is safe by construction: every gate in `channel-minimums.ts` reads an
 * unknown floor as "state none and let billing decide", so a failed catalogue
 * read costs the client-side hint, never the floor itself — billing holds the
 * same rule against the same figure and its 400 is what decides.
