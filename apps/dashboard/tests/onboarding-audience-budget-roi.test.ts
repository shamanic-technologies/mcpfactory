/**
 * Three onboarding surfaces that each reported something other than what they did.
 *
 * 1. A successful audience suggest APPENDS below the already-picked cards, so a user
 *    holding a full selection saw nothing move and read the click as a no-op. Worse, a
 *    run where every generated audience collided with one already stored produced NO
 *    message at all — one brand's user clicked "Find new audiences" five times against
 *    that silence (2026-07-29).
 * 2. The budget modal called the positive-replies outcome "contacts", naming the people
 *    emailed rather than what the budget buys, and contradicting its own goal label.
 * 3. The pricing summary, the checkout CTA and the Stripe amount each carried their own
 *    copy of the budget expression, and the custom card mirrored the typed amount into a
 *    second state — the shape that lets a charged amount lag a displayed one.
 * 4. The best-model step showed an ROI multiple while showing neither number it is
 *    computed from, so a return under 1x was unexplainable.
 *
 * Behavioural import isn't possible for onboarding.tsx (it pulls Clerk/posthog/api
 * through the `@` alias vitest does not resolve here), so these assert the load-bearing
 * source, matching the repo's other onboarding guards. strategy-model.ts carries no
 * runtime `@` import, so it gets a real call.
